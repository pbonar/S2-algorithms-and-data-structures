# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

This project implements a variety of algorithms and data structures using Java. It serves as an educational tool to understand fundamental concepts in computer science, providing examples and implementations of commonly used algorithms and data structures.

## Features

- Implementation of common data structures:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, and Binary Search Trees)
  - Graphs (Adjacency List and Matrix)

- Implementation of key algorithms:
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Searching algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
  - Graph algorithms
  - Dynamic programming examples
